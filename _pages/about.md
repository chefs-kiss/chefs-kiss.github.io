About Me
---
My name is Kim Mandery. I’m an Instructor of Computer Science in the [Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department](https://wp.stolaf.edu/mscs/) at St. Olaf College. I earned my M.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the University of Minnesota - Duluth studying under Tracy Bibelnieks. I earned degrees in Applied Mathematics, and Statistics and Actuarial Science from University of Minnesota - Duluth.

Research 
---
My research area is machine learning, with a focus on the ethical and social dimensions of algorithmic systems. As machine learning continues to shape decision-making in healthcare, education, hiring, and more, it's critical to ensure these systems are fair, interpretable, and accountable. My work explores techniques for algorithm auditing and data storytelling to surface hidden biases and make complex models more transparent and understandable to diverse audiences. I also study natural language processing, bioinformatics, and curricula design. Across these areas, I aim to develop methods and practices that make machine learning accessible to all audiences.

Personal Life

I’m originally from Rochester, Minnesota — best known for the Mayo Clinic (allegedly), but if you ask me, the real reason folks come is to behold the giant corncob water tower. I will say “ope” when I bump into literally anything, and love getting lost in a really good fantasy series (always up for recs!). I have three very opinionated dogs, all named after hobbits (yes, they live up to the names), and I play way too much Magic: The Gathering for someone who swears they’re just a “casual player.” I mostly play Commander and have a soft spot for enchantment-heavy decks and silly commanders. If I wasn’t an instructor, I’d probably have an in-home pottery studio where I’d make slightly wobbly mugs, listen to fantasy audiobooks, and occasionally step out to feed my small, delightfully well-behaved herd of mini goats.
