Research 
---
My research area is machine learning, with a focus on the ethical and social dimensions of algorithmic systems. As machine learning continues to shape (or at least influence) decision-making in most aspects of the world that we live in, it's critical to ensure these systems are fair, interpretable, and accountable. My work explores methods and practices that make machine learning accessible to all audiences.

Personal Life

I’m originally from Rochester, Minnesota, best known for the Mayo Clinic (allegedly), but if you ask me, the real reason folks come is to behold the giant corncob water tower. I will say “ope” when I bump into literally anything, and love getting lost in a really good fantasy series (always up for recs!). I have three very opinionated dogs, all named after hobbits (yes, they live up to the names), and I play way too much Magic: The Gathering.
