**Course Description**: This course introduces differential and integral calculus of functions of a single real variable, including trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Derivatives, integrals, and differential equations are explored graphically, symbolically, and numerically. Applications of these topics are emphasized throughout the course. 

**Course Goals**: Through the lens of calculus, we will:
- approach problems from multiple perspectives, employing a variety of strategies.
- recognize and employ patterns, structures, and models appropriate to particular theoretical or contextual problems.
- represent and interpret information in numeric, symbolic, or graphical forms.
