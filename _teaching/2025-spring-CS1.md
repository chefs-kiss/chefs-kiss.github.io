**Course Description**: This course introduces the perspectives and methods of computer science. Students learn to develop algorithms, which are step-by-step procedures for accomplishing a task. Students translate these algorithms into a programming language, utilizing common programming structures. The structures covered include variables, functions, loops, control flow, basic data structures, classes, and a brief introduction to object-oriented programming.

**Course Goals**: Through the lens of computer science fundamentals, we will:
- develop an understanding of core programming concepts, including data types, control flow, functions, and abstraction
- design and implement simple programs that solve meaningful problems
- explore how computers execute code and represent data
- apply computational thinking to reason through novel challenges
- collaborate and communicate effectively in both individual and team-based settings
