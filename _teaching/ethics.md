**Course Description**: Artificial intelligence is no longer just a technical challenge, it is a social and an ethical one as well. The systems we design have real consequences for peopleâ€™s lives, shaping decisions about work, identity, privacy, safety, and justice. This course examines AI through an ethical lens, using case studies to critically analyze the impacts of AI systems and the responsibilities of those who design, deploy, and regulate them. Students will develop their own original case study with interactive components to engage a variety of audiences, and create podcasts to practice communicating complex issues clearly and persuasively. Topics include professional and ethical responsibilities, risk, liability, bias, intellectual property, privacy, surveillance, and broader social impacts of AI. 

**Course Goals**: Through the lens of an ethical framework, we will:
- critically analyze AI systems using case studies.
- connect ethical concepts to the design, deployment, and impact of AI in society.
- work effectively, both individually and collaboratively, on research and creative projects.
- communicate effectively about AI ethics through managing your own website.
- create an original case study with interactive elements to engage diverse audiences.
