**Course Description**: The software we design has real effects in people's lives. This course explores the ethical and social considerations inherent in computer-based systems, develops skills in thinking about those considerations and in collecting data to determine their effects, and expands students' abilities to integrate these issues and skills into software development procedures, largely through an extensive team analysis of a "live" software project. Coursework uses extended case studies and surveys topics such as professional and ethical responsibilities, risk, liability, intellectual property, privacy, and computer crime.

**Course Goals**: Through the lens of an ethical framework, we will:
- develop and interpret software to domain use-cases
- develop working software that satisfies coding best practices
- work effectively, both individually and in teams
- communicate information effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences
