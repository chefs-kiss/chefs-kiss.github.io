First post on the site. Some thoughts on designing a personal website. 

I've spent the last day trying out different website templates, and have finally decided on one *yay!* I don't know why it has taken me this long to finally use codespaces on GitHub. Definitely easier than writing a website in RStudio and having to manually deploy via git to netlify.

Thoughts so far-- excited to have a place to jot down things that are happening, collect course materials, and most importantly have an official site that isn't my dusty LinkedIn profile. I know I need it, but would rather have content I create rather than digest-- still like it for ideas though.

The rest of the week is going to be spend on getting some diagrams for the ML for Biologist talk in July, and getting together resources for the department workshop on Thursday.

Anyway, off to a pilates class tongight with some friends. Hopefully can walk tomorrow :dizzy:
