**The Fight for Privacy**: Protecting Dignity, Idenitity, and Love in the Digital Age *by Danielle Keats Citron*
This book covers dignity and identity with regards to intimate data through the lens of *intimate privacy*. Intimate privacy often gets overrruled in legal frameworks in favor of big corporation agendas. This covers in great detail the players who often violate intimate privacy, the current legal framework, a call-to-action for guidelines, and what we can do as good data stewards to protect individuals' intimate privacy.
