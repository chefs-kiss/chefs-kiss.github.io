**The Fight for Privacy**: Protecting Dignity, Idenitity, and Love in the Digital Age *by Danielle Keats Citron*.
This book explores dignity and identity in the context of intimate data, focusing on the concept of intimate privacyâ€”the protection of information related to our bodies, health, gender, and relationships. Citron argues that intimate privacy is often compromised by legal frameworks that prioritize corporate interests over individual rights. The book examines in detail the actors who violate intimate privacy, the limitations of current laws, and offers a compelling call-to-action for stronger protections. It also outlines how we, as responsible data stewards, can help safeguard the intimate privacy of others.
